- TensorFlow 2.9.1

Included examples:

- TensorFlow
  - MNIST
  - SSD Object Detection
  - DeepLab
  - PoseNet
  - Style Transfer
  - Text Classification
  - Bert Question and Answer
  - Super Resolution
- MediaPipe
  - Hand Tracking
  - Blaze Face
  - Face Mesh
  - Blaze Pose (Full body)
  - Selfie Segmentation

Included prebuilt libraries:

| | iOS | Android | macOS | Ubuntu | Windows |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Core CPU |âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|
| Metal Delegate |âœ…| - |âœ…| - | - |
| GPU Delegate | - |âœ…| - | âœ… Experimental | - |
| NNAPI Delegate | - |âœ…| - | - | - |

- You need to install OpenGL ES and OpenCL to run GPU Delegate on Linux. See [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/gpu_support.html#opengl-es-setup-on-linux-desktop) for details.

## Install TensorFlow Lite for Unity

- If you want to try all examples, clone this repository with [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
- If you just need TensorFlow Lite libraries via UPM, open the file `Packages/manifest.json` and add following lines into `scopedRegistries` and `dependencies` section.

```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "package.openupm.com",
      "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
      "scopes": [
        "com.cysharp.unitask"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "npm",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [
        "com.github.asus4"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    // Core TensorFlow Lite libraries
    "com.github.asus4.tflite": "2.9.1-p1",
    // Utilities for TFLite
    "com.github.asus4.tflite.common": "2.9.1-p1",
    // Utilities for MediaPipe
    "com.github.asus4.mediapipe": "2.9.1-p1",
    ...// other dependencies
  }
}
```

## Build TensorFlow Lite libraries

Pre-built libraries are included. If you want to build the latest TFLite,

1. Clone [TensorFlow library](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/)
2. Run `./configure` in the TensorFlow library
3. Run `./build_tflite.py` (Python3) to build for each platform

  ```sh
  # Update iOS, Android and macOS
  ./build_tflite.py --tfpath ../tensorflow -ios -android -macos

  # Build with XNNPACK
  ./build_tflite.py --tfpath ../tensorflow -macos -xnnpack
  ```

## TIPS

\[Android\] You can see logs from tflite by filtering with "tflite"  

```bash
# Filtering logcat only Unity and tflite
adb logcat Unity:V tflite:V "*:S"
```
